# who-wrote-webpack
If you are like me, you may be wondering who wrote webpack, or to put it another way who is the aothor of webpack? Well I googled it and figured it out, but the answer didn't come in the form of a helpful box at the top of google like so many things do these days, so I thought maybe I will make a github repo and maybe google will index it to make it easier for people to find out the answer to this question in the future. Tobias Koppers aka @sokra wrote webpack.
